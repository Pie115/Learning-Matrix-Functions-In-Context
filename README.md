# Learning Matrix Functions In Context

Code used in our experiments. Main code for generating Gemini and Open Source Model Data can be found in updated scripts folder, particularly the generate_class folder. Code for plots, as well as evaluation on non LLM models can be found in the all notebooks folder. 

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve complex tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), where models learn from a few input-output pairs without explicit fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore the capacity of LLMs to solve non-linear numerical computations, with specific emphasis on functions of the Singular Value Decomposition. Our experiments show that while LLMs perform comparably to traditional models such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based Linear Regression and Neural Networks (NN) for simpler tasks, they outperform these models on more complex tasks, particularly in the case of top-k Singular Values. Furthermore, LLMs demonstrate strong scalability, maintaining high accuracy even as the matrix size increases. Additionally, we found that LLMs can achieve high accuracy with minimal prior examples, converging quickly and avoiding the overfitting seen in classical models. These results suggest that LLMs could provide an efficient alternative to classical methods for solving high-dimensional problems. Future work will focus on extending these findings to larger matrices and more complex matrix operations while exploring the effect of using different numerical representations in ICL.
